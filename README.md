# Amazon_Bestseller_Reader

### Inspiration project:

I was inspired by the Mashup project "COVID-19 Audio Alert"

### Physical inputs/outputs:

I used SenseHat for greeting messages and for displaying a simple figure.

### Non-physical inputs/outputs:

I used bs4 for web scraping, gTTS for text to speech and pygame for playing audio.

### Interaction:

The goal of this project is to extract the titles and prices of the top ten articles of the amazon category "electronics and photo",converting this data to a mp3 file and playing the audio generated.
